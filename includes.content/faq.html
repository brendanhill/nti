                                        <p>"EEG" is an abbreviation for the term Electroencephalography which is the study of electrical activity within the brain.  Electroencephalography is of Greek origin and literally means:<br><br>

                                        <p>However, it is commonly used to refer to the actual brainwave recording or a neurodiagnostic technology group or department.  
Example:  "Call EEG to get an EEG on this patient."</p>
