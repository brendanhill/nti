                                    <p class="body_text">There is a broad variety of places to work once you complete the Neurodiagnostic Technology Institute program and successfully pass the board exam to become a Registered EEG Technologist.  Here’s a quick overview of the major locations and what you might expect:</p>
                                    <b class="bold_sub_heading">Hospitals</b>
                                    <p class="body_text">Electroencephalography (EEG) Technologists are important members of the healthcare team in a fast-paced hospital environment.  When adults and children arrive at the emergency room seeking treatment for head injuries, seizures, loss of consciousness, or altered mental status EEG Technologists provide doctors with critical information to help with diagnosing the problem. After treatment begins, they conduct additional studies to monitor patients' response to the treatment plan and progress. </p>
                                    <p class="body_text">Hospitals are unique working environments that offer many different experiences and opportunities that you won’t find in private practice.  Because hospitals provide emergency services around the clock, you can choose which shift you want to work.  You will see a greater variety of patient injuries and illnesses working in a hospital.  You’ll work with a larger number of professional medical staff including doctors, specialists, nurses, and other medical technologists.  There are more opportunities for promotion and advancement within a hospital system.</p>
                                    
                                    <b class="bold_sub_heading">Private Practice for Adults</b>
                                    <p class="body_text">Private practice offices provide more specialized treatment for adults with epilepsy, degenerative diseases, follow-up for stroke patients, dizziness, and memory disorders. Electroencephalography (EEG) Technologists provide valuable information to doctors and specialists in the creation and monitoring of patient treatment plans and progress.</p>
                                    <p class="body_text">A private practice office offers a more structured and controlled work environment than a hospital.  Generally, you will work regular office hours on Monday through Friday. In a private practice office you will be a member of a small group of healthcare professionals and be a valued part of the team.</p>
                                    
                                    <b class="bold_sub_heading">Pediatric Private Practice</b>
                                    <p class="body_text">Pediatric private practices specialize in the treatment of infants, children and young adults with congenital brain malformations or injuries, seizures, genetic disorders, and those with developmental delays. Electroencephalography (EEG) Technologists work alongside doctors and specialists to provide information which will help diagnose these young patients and monitor their treatment plan.</p>
                                    <p class="body_text">Pediatric private practice offices are family-focused and will give you opportunities to work with children and their parents. They provide services Monday through Friday during regular business office hours. You will be a valued member of a healthcare team with special skills to reassure young patients, understand and communicate both information and feelings and collaborate with physicians and specialists.</p>
                                    
                                    <b class="bold_sub_heading">Traveling EEG Technologists</b>
                                    <p class="body_text">If you like to travel and appreciate different work environments, you may enjoy being a traveling EEG Technologist.  Traveling EEG Technologists go to new places, have new experiences, and work with new people for contracted periods of time. You can work in a variety of healthcare environments in cities across the country. In each location you will be a respected member of the healthcare team, who is brought in for your special skills as a neurodiagnostic professional.</p>
