                                        <p class="body_text">Neurodiagnostic Technology is a broad term used to describe several categories of neurological testing.  It includes Electroencephalography, Long Term Monitoring (LTM), Polysomnography (PSG), Evoked Potentials (EP), Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM), and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS).</p>
                                    
                                    <b class="bold_sub_heading">What does "EEG" mean?</b>
                                        <p class="body_text">"EEG" is an abbreviation for the term Electroencephalography which is the study of electrical activity within the brain.  Electroencephalography is of Greek origin and literally means:<br /><br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electro = electric<br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encephalo =  brain<br />
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graph = writing</p>
                                        <p class="body_text">However, it is commonly used to refer to the actual brainwave recording or a neurodiagnostic technology group or department.  
Example:  "Call EEG to get an EEG on this patient."</p>
                                    
                                    <b class="bold_sub_heading">How does an EEG work?</b>
                                        <p class="body_text">The nervous system functions when one nerve cell successfully communicates a message to another nerve cell.  These messages carry electrical charges which can be measured and recorded by special equipment connected to electrodes placed on the scalp.  </p>
                                    
                                    <b class="bold_sub_heading">What is the demand for EEG Technologists?</b>
